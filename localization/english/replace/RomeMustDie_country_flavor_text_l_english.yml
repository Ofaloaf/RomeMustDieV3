  WRE_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Roman Empire has split and consolidated more times than Imperial propagandists are comfortable admitting, but it has always preserved in one form or another. Now, however, it teeters on the brink: struggling to recover from the Wars of Attila, the Western Empire is plagued by discontent within and emboldened neighbors abroad."
  ERE_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Roman Empire has split and consolidated more times than Imperial propagandists are comfortable admitting, but it has always preserved in one form or another. The Eastern half of the empire has had its share of fair knocks, but it weathered the Crisis of the 7th Century better than most expected, and further challenges in the 13th and 15th centuries also saw it battered but still standing. Can it now withstand the 18th century?"
  GLL_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Gaul once enjoyed a preeminent position within the Roman Empire, but the ravages of the Hunnic Wars and the increasing Italy-centricness of the Roman court left it neglected and anarchic. Mutinies and rebellions have occurred several times in the years since Attila was defeated, but the Gallic Empire has proven to be the largest and most coordinated of them all."
  FRK_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, Frankia lies at a crossroads. With the Roman world in crisis, the realm could expand its influence in the rich lands of Gaul, but at the same time ancient Germania years for leadership and unity. The Romantic world or the Germanic world — which way shall the Franks go?"
  GTL_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Kingdom of the Geats has withstood attacks from Svears, Danes, and even Scanians, but can it withstand the march of progress?"
  HNN_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Attila, the Scourge of God, rocked the old order in Europe just a generation earlier. The Huns were eventually defeated, but the old veterans have passed on stories of glory to a new generation, and the puppet government of the Huns struggles to keep its legitimacy. From his prison on the Danube, an ailing but still-living Attila cooly watches this discontent with delight."
  POW_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The last loyal bastion of Romanitas in North America, the Prefecture struggles to maintain its authority over both colonists and native tribes. Can it straddle both worlds, and weave them together into one?"
  CUB_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The 'Society of Easterners in Cuba' is one of the most profitable Roman ventures in the New World and, much to the chagrin of the West, operates out of Constantinople. The best mercantile minds of the Eastern Mediterranean created a lucrative economic empire in the Caribbean, built on the sweat of enslaved labor and intense politicking in the Imperial metropole."
