  garibaldi_events.4.d: "While [SCOPE.sCharacter('garibaldi_scope').GetFullName]'s abilities to move the minds of commoners have proven useful in the fight against [SCOPE.sCountry('garibaldi_peasants_foe_scope').GetAdjective], his radical preachings are starting to turn some of [SCOPE.sState('garibaldi_peasants_state_scope').GetName]'s [GetPopType('farmers').GetName] against our own rule as well — with several government ministers now demanding he be gagged."

  italian_unification.1.d:0 "Under the heroic leadership of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName], the Britannic nation has been birthed into the world. Unified under a common banner, Britannia will surely shape the future of Europe and the world."
  italian_unification.1.f: ""Yes, young men, Britannia owes to you an undertaking which has merited the applause of the universe. You have conquered and you will conquer still, because you are prepared for the tactics that decide the fate of battles.

  italian_unification.2.d: "The small Britannian state of [SCOPE.sCountry('italian_annex_country').GetName] has wisely decided to join our efforts to unify the Britannic people."
  italian_unification.2.f: ""The old city-states have a quaint romantic appeal; we can look back to the days of Arthur to see a thriving Britain. But to thrive again, we must look forward, not back. It is unity under a single state that will drive the Britannic people to greatness once more.""
  italian_unification.2.a:0 "Diplomacy has won the day!"

  italian_unification.4.d_coup: "Inspired by calls for the reunification of Britain, nationalist rebels have seized control of [SCOPE.sState('capital_scope').GetCityHubName] and declared the government of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] to have fallen."
  italian_unification.4.f: ""Traitors! Traitors in the midst! Sound the alarm, call for the guards at once!"\n\n"Do you mean the suited men beside me, sir? I should hope so, since you were foolish enough to announce your presence. Now, I shall make this plain, as your raving ineptitude forced our hand in the first place: a united Britannia is rising. It demands a place on the world stage, and it won't be cared for by men of your ill-fitting ilk.""

  italian_unification.5.f: "A unified Britain has never been far from the lips of the mad and the ambitious alike. Indeed, a splendid reawakening of the island would give even God pause.

  italian_unification.6.f: "What the aide brought to him was incredulous: another attempt at bringing Albion under a single banner. It seemed impossible, divided between at least a half-dozen petty lords and city-states that would as soon strangle each other as Europe. But as the aide spoke, it became plain that this was no idle boast. No, this merited envoys, carrying either a sword or an olive branch."
  italian_unification.6.a: "Offer our sympathies to the new regime."
  italian_unification.6.b: "We have no common cause with these terrorists."

The footman who approached [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim] with sweat seeping from every cracked pore carried a blood-red letter. The Britannic holdings had entered revolt. The next sweating aide to enter carried another report: these revolting territories called for reinforcements. Reinforcements, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstNameNoFormatting] knew, that would surely be coming."
  italian_unification.7.a: "Call up the troops at once!"

  italian_unification.8.f: ""Mother… my mind is made up. I am going to the revolution, with or without your blessing."\n\n"Good, fine, go! No son of mine would ever waste his life on something so meaningless as a flag. I've already lost brothers and uncles to this sort of useless adjudication of penne lengths. Stay here and be safe!"\n\n"It's anything but useless, mother! We have a chance to be one Britannia again. We could go anywhere, do anything again. We would have #bold something#! again!""
