  objective_barbarians_at_the_gates: "Barbarians at the Gates"
  objective_barbarians_at_the_gates_desc: "Attila, dictator and so-called 'Emperor' of the Huns, wreaked havoc on Europe just a generation ago. Although the tyrant was defeated and contained, his wars posed a serious challenge to Imperial dominance, and the ideas set forth by the Pannonian Revolution have left many wondering if a new order can be forged at long last."
  objective_orbis_romanus_idle_header: "The Roman World stands on a precipice"
  objective_orbis_romanus_idle_hint: "Good luck"
  objective_barbarians_at_the_gates_name_HNN: "The Hunnic Restoration"
  objective_barbarians_at_the_gates_desc_HNN: "Since the time of fratricidal King Bleda, the Huns have been peaceable-enough neighbors of the Romans. Sometimes foederati, sometimes neutral, the Huns always managed to maintain a precarious existence on the Danubian frontier.\n\nThat all changed when the Pannonian Revolution erupted, setting Europe alight with feverish dreams of Liberty and Reason. Then, just as suddenly, a Hunnic officer of humble background, Attila, seized the reigns of power, and extinguished that light.\n\nIt took twenty-five years of fighting, but the Huns were eventually contained. Now, the restored Hunnic Kingdom struggles to keep the loyalty of its rebellious subjects. Will it last? Will it fall? Will the Scourge of God, long-exiled, return to power one last time?"
  objective_barbarians_at_the_gates_name_FRK: "Frankish Unity?"
  objective_barbarians_at_the_gates_desc_FRK: "The Franks of the Rhine have historically been a fractuous lot, never consolidated enough to pose a real threat to Roman supremacy in Belgica. With the wars of Attila and the collapse of Roman rule in Gaul, the old order has gone upside-down. Now the Franks rally around a united leadership at long last, and the Gallo-Roman warlords of the north struggle to coalesce around a single government. \n\nWill the Franks be able to put aside their petty squabbles and build a new realm, a #italic Francia#!, for themselves out of the wreckage of Roman rule?"
  objective_barbarians_at_the_gates_name_LIT: "Lietuva"
  objective_barbarians_at_the_gates_desc_LIT: "Rome is not central to every empire on earth. The Lithuanian Empire beyond the Vistula is its own self-made realm. Once a simple confederation of Baltic peoples, it has formed and reformed itself countless times over, growing, shrinking, winning, losing, always changing, never the same.\n\nThe modern Lithuanian state is a complex mosaic of laws and traditions, attempting to placate Balts and Slavs, magnates and peasants, radicals and reactionaries alike. Can it maintain its delicate balance and find its next moves in the face of challenges both foreign and domestic?"

  objective_orbis_romanus: "Orbis Romanus"
  objective_orbis_romanus_desc: "Once, the Roman World seemed as immortal and absolute as God Himself. Since the Attilan Wars, however, that old certainty has vanished overnight. The Empire stumbles along, faced with usurpers, economic collapse, and visions of liberty clouding the minds of its citizens. Is this the end of Rome, or the beginning of a new epoch in Rome's long history?"
  objective_orbis_romanus_name_WRE: "Imperium Romanum"
  objective_orbis_romanus_desc_WRE: "The western half of the Roman Empire is in a perilous state. The Pannonian Revolution and the Wars of Attila put an enormous strain on the Empire, and its survival only came about by empowering federates and granting extraordinary powers to magnates in the provinces. Now the West is splintering, with warlords rampant across the empire.\n\nThe situation in the capital is hardly any better. Diminishing resources have simply amplified factionalism, as every senator and general squabbles to hoard what scraps of power and wealth they can find. Can the Western Roman Empire pull itself together, or is this its final act?"
  objective_orbis_romanus_name_ERE: "Basileía Rhōmaíōn"
  objective_orbis_romanus_desc_ERE: "The battered Eastern Empire did not bear the full brunt of Attila's aggression, but it has fared little better than the West nonetheless.\n\nThe East has been battered by countless crises over the centuries, from the Slavic migrations and Avar incursions that crossed the Danube in the north, to the challenging rise of Islam in Arabia in the south. It has not recovered from all these challenges, either; the Slavs were only placated with extensive grants of land in the imperial heartland, and the strain of wars against Arabia and Persia eventually led to the collapse of Roman rule in the south and Egyptian independence.\n\nThese wounds are, at least, long in the past. The East is more stable than the West for now, but for how much longer will that hold true?"
  objective_orbis_romanus_name_SOI: "The Gallo-Roman Remnant"
  objective_orbis_romanus_desc_SOI: "Attila's invasion of the west shattered Roman Gaul. Emergency authority was granted to lords and federates across the prefecture to deal with the threat of Attila, but once the Hunnic menace was defeated no one was in a hurry to cede their powers back to Rome.\n\nThe rulers of the old Suessiones in norther Gaul are perhaps the strongest of this post-Attilan magnates, proud of their independence and their newfound power. Yet they are beset on all sides by hungry neighbors, from the Franks to the east, the Burgundians to the south, and fellow Gallo-Roman warlords in the west."
  objective_orbis_romanus_name_GLL: "Divided Gaul"
  objective_orbis_romanus_desc_GLL: "Attila's invasion of the west shattered Roman rule. Emergency authority was granted to lords and federates across the empire to deal with the threat of Attila, but once the Hunnic menace was defeated no one was in a hurry to cede their powers back to Rome.\n\nGallia has fought the most stubbornly against the re-consolidation of Roman rule. Various separatist and revolutionary movements have flared up in the years since Attila's defeat; the Gallic Empire is only the latest in a long string of regional revolts."
  objective_orbis_romanus_name_PGN: "Old Roman Britain"
  objective_orbis_romanus_desc_PGN: "Britannia was in the Roman fold for only four hundred years, but those centuries had a lasting impact on the island's culture and politics. The great kings of the sub-Roman period, like Ambrosius Aurelianus and Artorius, forged a great Romano-British realm which used Roman and Welsh techniques alike to stave off Irish, Saxon, and Gallo-Roman incursions for centuries.\n\nTheir military triumphs were soon overshadowed by their political defeats. The centralization of Britannia was never completed; too many chiefs held too much power and too much particularism for the island to remain united for long. These days, the lords of the #italic Pagensis#!—#italic Ill Paes#! in the Brithenig tongue of the Romano-British people—are one of the last to claim any direct descendence from old Arthurian Britain."

  objective_struggle_for_the_new_world_desc: "Gradual forays, from the time of Leif Eriksson onwards, have led to extensive exchanges of ideas, wealth, and people between indigenous nations and colonizers in the New World."
  objective_struggle_for_the_new_world_name_IRO: "Haudenosaunee"
  objective_struggle_for_the_new_world_desc_IRO: "The confederation of the Five Nations is the strongest of the indigenous states east of the Mississippi."
  objective_struggle_for_the_new_world_name_POW: "Praefectura Occidentali"
  objective_struggle_for_the_new_world_desc_POW: "The Praetorian Prefecture of the West is the New World's great bastion of #italic Romanitas#!, a modern expression of Roman imperialism and a experiment in the limits of Romanization policies. The Prefecture relies on traditional methods of exerting Roman rule, heavily cultivating Roman sympathies among long elites and enacting policies that encourage urbanization and a deepening reliance on Imperial administration.\n\nThe result of this has been the creation of a heavily-Romanized class of indigenous bureaucrats and elites, lording over a lower class that has a much weaker experience with Roman culture."
  objective_struggle_for_the_new_world_name_MEX: "Mexicanum-Mēxihco"
  objective_struggle_for_the_new_world_desc_MEX: "The conquests of the adventurer Cortesius Metellinensis were condemned by envious elites in Roman Cuba, but all their opprobrium and threats simply compelled him to remain in Mexico and use it as his own powerbase. Since then, the Cortesian dynasty has ruled an independent empire of Nahua peoples constantly roiling with discontent.\n\nAlthough the Hispano-Roman elites have adopted some elements of Nahua culture, the imperial government has never succeeded in fully shaking off the stink of being foreign upstarts."
  objective_struggle_for_the_new_world_name_KAI: "Dai Kaigai-koku"
  objective_struggle_for_the_new_world_desc_KAI: "The Great Overseas Empire is Japan's most daring foray into overseas expansion. "
