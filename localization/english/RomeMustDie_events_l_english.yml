  fall_of_rome_events.100.t:0 "Fall of the Roman Empire"
  fall_of_rome_events.100.d:0 "The collapse of a legitimate Roman government has ushered in a new age of warlordism."
  fall_of_rome_events.100.f:1 ""Empires, like dreams, are made of an intangible material, so fragile they can end at any given time with no previous warning. They hold, however, the same insane appeal. Even if the thread that holds together their seams is invisible, and every suture hides a wound.\n\nThousands of years of imperial rule, ended in just a moment.""
  fall_of_rome_events.100.a:0 "Oh no."
  fall_of_rome_events.100.ab:0 "[SCOPE.sC('scope_random_warlord_one').GetName] will be the new Rome!"
  fall_of_rome_events.100.b:0 "[SCOPE.sC('scope_random_warlord_two').GetName] will rise!"
  fall_of_rome_events.100.c:0 "[SCOPE.sC('scope_random_warlord_three').GetName] is finally free!"
  fall_of_rome_events.100.aa:0 "[SCOPE.sC('scope_random_warlord_four').GetName] will reunite all Romans!"
  attila_evts.1.t: "Attila escapes his exile!"
  attila_evts.1.d: "A conspiracy to free Attila was uncovered only after the old despot tricked his guards on Great Proilabum Island on the lower Danube and fled his prison. He is clearly planning to return and establish his own rule once more!"
  attila_evts.1.f: ""Let your courage rise and your own fury burst forth! Now show your cunning, Huns, now your deeds of arms! Let the wounded exact in return the death of his foe; let the unwounded revel in slaughter of the enemy."\n\nThe old man smiled. It was his greatest speech, from a more glorious time. Yet, he hoped, he would have once more chance to revel in victory, if the fates let him."
  attila_evts.1.a: "We cannot let the Scourge of God undo the cause of peace!"
  
  attila_evts.2.t: "Attila Restored!"
  attila_evts.2.d: "Attila, surrounded by roaring crowds and cheering soldiers, has returned to the capital. The old government fled before they were forced to leave.\n\nAttila is the undisputed master of the Huns."
  attila_evts.2.f: "He looked out over the throngs pouring into Aquincum's central square. They were here for #italic him#!. They would always be there for him.\n\nThey were #N his#!, now and forevermore."
  attila_evts.2.a: "Long live Attila, by the grace of God, Lord of the Huns!"

  fall_of_rome_events.1.t: "Language Reform?"
  fall_of_rome_events.1.d: "Radical intellectuals, recognizing that the language of Ovid and Cicero is not actually the language Romans actually speak anymore, have proposed a reformed Standard Latin which would be nearly incomprehensible to Caesar."
  fall_of_rome_events.1.f: ""'Venni, vidi, vinsi'?" The elderly senator slapped the writing sample with the back of his hand. "Publius, what is this nonsense?"\n\nPublio sighed. "It's 'Veni, Vidi, Vici.' Caesar's famous line. You just said it out loud the same way you'd say it if it was written the classical way."\n\nThe old man's frown deepened. "Well, then why not keep writing it that way?"\n\n"Because it doesn't make sense! Half the letters don't match the sounds anyone uses anymore. If Latin is to remain the world's language, then it has to actually work!""
  fall_of_rome_events.1.a: "The foundations of Romanitas are dignity and tradition, and this has neither!"
  fall_of_rome_events.1.b: "The strength of Rome rests on our ability to change with the times."
  fall_of_rome_events.1.c: "Are our standards falling so low? Tell teachers to focus on the classics!"
  fall_of_rome_events.2.t: "The Great Apostasy"
  fall_of_rome_events.2.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('insane_ruler').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('insane_ruler').GetFullName]'s surprise declaration of the return of ancient Roman paganism has met reactions ranging from sheer bafflement to righteous anger. Nobody wanted this, and nobody will follow this insane directive. The [SCOPE.sCharacter('insane_ruler').GetPrimaryRoleTitle]'s reputation has been permanently marred by this bizarre and ridiculous action."
  fall_of_rome_events.2.f: ""Worshipping #italic Jupiter#! as if we're Caesar's peers back in some dark age of superstition? This is absurd! Obscene! Who #italic does#! that sort of thing, even in desperation?" The speaker shook his head sadly. "I'm afraid I must ask for our dear leader to step down, if this is the only kind of decision [SCOPE.sCharacter('insane_ruler').GetHerHis] mind can produce.""
  fall_of_rome_events.2.a: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('insane_ruler').GetFullName] must retire from public life."
  fall_of_rome_events.2.b: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('insane_ruler').GetHerHis|U] decision was terrible, but [SCOPE.sCharacter('insane_ruler').GetSheHe] cannot leave now."
  fall_of_rome_events.2.c: "A period of convalescence may help [SCOPE.sCharacter('insane_ruler').GetHerHim]."
  fall_of_rome_events.2.c.tt: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('insane_ruler').GetFullNameNoFormatting]'s faith has been shattered by this ordeal, and [SCOPE.sCharacter('insane_ruler').GetSheHe] is no longer #bold pious#!."
  fall_of_rome_events.2.dd: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('devout_leader').GetFullName] may be able to talk the [SCOPE.sCharacter('insane_ruler').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] out of apostasy."
