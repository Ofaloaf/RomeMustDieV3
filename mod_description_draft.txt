Rome sucks. It's fascinating, don't get me wrong, I love reading about it, but I _have_ read about it and I've concluded it sucked. It was dysfunctional from beginning to end, its government was built on shaky fictions, and it died at the hand of the world it itself created.

I want you to understand that Rome sucked. I want you to understand that no matter what, what made Rome Roman cursed it to suck, and the only way to be free of that curse is to not be Roman. And I don't just mean the Roman Empire proper, but Romanity itself — I'm not going to let you escape this by moving some sort of Romanophilia to a Romano-British Arthurian Britain, or the Greek eastern part of the empire. It was rotten, it was always rotten, and I want you to internalize that.

Here is a scenario where Rome survived into an equivalent of the Victorian Era. This does not mean the Romans did _well_, or lead the world into this period of blood and iron. Far from it! This Rome, like the Rome of late antiquity, has survived through sheer intertia. It's old, it's imploding, it's under-industrialized and overstretched, it's tired and it's ready to die. You can help nudge that death along if you want, either from within or abroad. If you want to save it, sure, give it a whirl — there is content in this mod that will not make that easy for you. If there are Roman glories to be had in this scenario, they will be made in _spite_ of a new Caesar, not because of him.
