Here is a scenario where Rome survived into an equivalent of the Victorian Era. This does not mean the Romans did _well_, or led the world into this period of blood and iron. Far from it! This Rome, like the Rome of late antiquity, has survived through sheer inertia. It's old, it's imploding, it's under-industrialized and overstretched, it's tired and it's ready to die. You can help nudge that death along if you want, either from within or abroad. If you want to save it, sure, give it a whirl â€” there is content in this mod that will not make that easy for you. If there are Roman glories to be had in this scenario, they will be made in _spite_ of a new Caesar, not because of him.
